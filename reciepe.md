Heat butter or oil in a pan. Add ginger-garlic paste, onion, and stir till onions are soft.
Next, add tomatoes, mix vegetables, and stir-fry in high flame till they are 90% cooked and they have still little crispiness left.
Then add water, maggi masala, red chili powder, garam masala powder and mix well.
Bring water to boil, and add maggi noodles, close lid, and cook for 2-3 minutes or until water is absorbed. Stir in between.
Finish with chopped coriander leaves and serve maggi noodles recipe hot.
